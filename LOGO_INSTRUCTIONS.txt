LOGO SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
=======================

To display your restaurant logo on the website:

1. Save your logo file as "logo.png" in the same folder as index.html
2. The logo should be:
   - Square or rectangular format
   - Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or larger
   - PNG format with transparent background (preferred)
   - The website will automatically resize it to 50x50 pixels in the navigation

3. If you don't have the logo yet, the website will still work but show a broken image icon. You can add it later.

The logo appears in:
- Navigation bar (top left)
- Footer section
