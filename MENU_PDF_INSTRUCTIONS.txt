MENU PDF UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS
=============================

Please upload your menu PDF files to the same folder as index.html

REQUIRED FILES:
---------------
1. menu-dinein.pdf    - Your Dine-In Menu PDF
2. menu-takeaway.pdf  - Your Takeaway Menu PDF

FILE LOCATION:
--------------
Upload both PDF files to:
/Users/Shaheen/

(Or wherever your index.html file is located)

IMPORTANT:
----------
- The filenames MUST be exactly:
  * menu-dinein.pdf (for Dine-In menu)
  * menu-takeaway.pdf (for Takeaway menu)
  
- Both files should be in PDF format (.pdf extension)

- Make sure the PDFs are not password protected

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
- Two separate full-screen menu pages:
  * menu-dinein.html (shows menu-dinein.pdf in full screen)
  * menu-takeaway.html (shows menu-takeaway.pdf in full screen)

- Each menu page features:
  * Full-screen PDF viewer (takes up entire screen)
  * Easy navigation between Dine-In and Takeaway menus
  * Download button to save the menu
  * Open in new tab option
  * Back button to return to homepage

- Users can:
  * View the menu in full screen for better readability
  * Switch between menu types using the menu switcher
  * Download the menu PDF
  * Open the menu in a new tab

TESTING:
--------
After uploading the PDFs:
1. Open menu-dinein.html in your browser - should show menu-dinein.pdf in full screen
2. Open menu-takeaway.html in your browser - should show menu-takeaway.pdf in full screen
3. Test the menu switcher to switch between pages
4. Test the download and "Open in New Tab" buttons

If the PDFs don't display:
- Check that the filenames are exactly correct (case-sensitive)
- Make sure the PDFs are in the same folder as the HTML files
- Try opening the PDFs directly in your browser to ensure they're not corrupted
- Check browser console for any error messages
